## Project Information

This project is a reproducible data analysis project that requires a data analyst to help the Chicago Bulls, an NBA team, find the best five starting players that the team can afford for the next season.  The project aims to use these data sets to analyze player statistics and salaries, team payrolls, and team statistics to find the best players for the team.

The project is hosted on a GitHub repository and includes a README.md file that describes the repository's contents, a data folder containing raw data and processed data files, a knitr report in html format that documents the analysis and findings, and a raw R Markdown file used to generate the knitr report.

This Project is divided into five sections:

**Introduction :** provides background information, a description of the scenario, the aim of the project, and its justification and importance.

**Reading and cleaning the raw data**  In which documents the process used to read and clean the raw data and provides a description of the data sets used.

**Exploratory analysis**  Documents the exploratory data analysis and includes checking for errors and missing values within the datasets, checking the distribution of variables, checking for relationships between variables, and justification for decisions made about data modelling.

**Data modelling and results** Includes creating a linear regression, checking assumptions, and interpreting model output.

**Player recommendations** The key part of the project that recommends the best five starting players based on the analysis and findings of the previous sections.
